# Graph Traversal

```'ADD' button adds a new node to the canvas```

```Press 's' while cursor is on a node to define it as the source``` 

```Press 'd' while cursor is on a node to define it as the destination```

```Press 'l' while cursor is on a node to initialize a node link. Press 'l' again on another node to complete the link```

```Press 'Enter' to calculate Path from source to destination ```

```Press 'space' to print the current graph```
